    <p><i>Yoko Ono: Music of the Mind</i> presents one of the most comprehensive 
    exhibitions to date of Yoko Ono, the trailblazing artist, celebrated musician, 
    and formidable campaigner for world peace. This remarkable retrospective—on 
    view at the MCA as the only US venue*—celebrates key moments of Ono’s career, 
    showcasing art driven by ideas and expressed in poetic, humorous, and profound ways. <br>
    Tracing Ono’s career since the 1950s, <i>Music of the Mind</i> presents over 200 works across a 
    variety of media including performance footage, music and sound recordings, scores, 
    film, photography, installation, and archival materials. Participatory artworks—a key 
    aspect of Ono’s practice—also feature in the exhibition, and visitors are invited to 
    partake in several interactive, instruction-based artworks throughout <i>Music of the Mind.</i></p>
